# Prime Send/Receive Go

Prime Send/Receive Go is a deposit and withdrawal management system with Coinbase Prime API integration, designed to work out of the box with Coinbase Prime's scalable deposit address solution. 

This is a sample application; test thoroughly and verify it meets your requirements before using.

## Overview

This system processes crypto deposits and withdrawals by monitoring Prime API transactions and maintaining user balances in a high-performance subledger.

**Core Features:**
- Deposit detection from Prime API
- Withdrawal confirmation tracking via idempotency keys
- Subledger with O(1) balance lookups
- Complete audit trail and transaction history
- Configurable via environment variables

## Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy and configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Prime API credentials (required)
PRIME_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/prime-credentials.json

# Database configuration (autogenerated, optional)
DATABASE_PATH=addresses.db

# Listener configuration (optional)
LISTENER_LOOKBACK_WINDOW=6h        # How far back to check for missed transactions
LISTENER_POLLING_INTERVAL=30s      # How often to poll Prime API
LISTENER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=15m      # How often to clean up processed transaction cache
ASSETS_FILE=assets.yaml            # Asset configuration file
```

**API Usage Notes:**
- The system fetches up to 500 transactions per wallet per polling cycle
- With the default 30-second polling interval, this provides adequate processing time per transaction
- The 6-hour lookback window ensures no transactions are missed between polling cycles
- If you exceed 500 transactions in 30 seconds, consider reducing the transaction limit

### 2. Asset Configuration

Create `assets.yaml` to specify which cryptocurrencies to monitor. You must specify the appropriate network, e.g. `ethereum-mainnet`. A full list of such networks is returned by the [List Assets](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/prime-api/rest-api/assets/list-assets) REST API:
```yaml
assets:
  - symbol: "USDC"
    network: "ethereum-mainnet"
  - symbol: "BTC"
    network: "bitcoin-mainnet"
  - symbol: "ETH"
    network: "ethereum-mainnet"
  - symbol: "SOL"
    network: "solana-mainnet"
```

### 3. User Configuration 

Edit `migrations/004_add_more_dummy_users.sql` to replace dummy users with your actual users:

```sql
-- Replace the dummy users with users
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES 
    ('John Doe', 'john.doe@yourcompany.com'),
    ('Jane Smith', 'jane.smith@yourcompany.com'),
    ('Your Customer', 'customer@yourcompany.com');
```

### 4. Initial Setup

Generate deposit addresses for provided users:
```bash
go run cmd/setup/main.go
```

This will:
- Initialize the database and run migrations (including user creation)
- Create Prime wallets for each asset
- Generate unique deposit addresses per user/asset
- Store addresses in the database

## Running the System

### Deposit & Withdrawal Listener

Start the transaction listener:
```bash
go run cmd/listener/main.go
```

This service:
- Monitors all configured wallets for new transactions
- Processes deposits automatically when they reach "TRANSACTION_IMPORTED" status
- Processes withdrawals when they reach "TRANSACTION_DONE" status
- Updates user balances
- Handles out-of-order transactions with lookback window
- Prevents duplicate processing

## How the Ledger Works

### Balance Management
- **Current Balances**: Stored in `account_balances` table for O(1) lookups
- **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail in `transactions` table
- **Atomic Updates**: Balance and transaction record updated together
- **Optimistic Locking**: Prevents race conditions with version control

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Fast balance lookups
account_balances: user_id, asset, balance, version

-- Complete transaction history  
transactions: user_id, asset, type, amount, balance_before, balance_after, external_transaction_id

-- User and address management
users: id, name, email
addresses: user_id, asset, address, wallet_id
```

## Withdrawal Tracking

### Idempotency Key Format
When creating withdrawals via Prime API, use this UUID idempotency key format:
```
{user_id_first_segment}-{uuid_fragment_without_first_segment}
```

**Generation Steps:**
1. Extract first segment from user ID (before first hyphen)
2. Generate a random UUID
3. Replace the UUID's first segment with the user ID's first segment

**Example:**
```bash
# If user ID is: abc123-def4-567g-890h-ijklmnop1234
# Generate random UUID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
# Use idempotency key: abc123-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Extract user ID prefix
USER_PREFIX=$(echo "$USER_ID" | cut -d'-' -f1)

# Generate random UUID and replace first segment
RANDOM_UUID=$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
WITHDRAWAL_UUID="${USER_PREFIX}-$(echo "$RANDOM_UUID" | cut -d'-' -f2-)"
```

**Why This Works:**
The system matches withdrawals to users by comparing the first segment of the user ID with the first segment of the idempotency key. This maintains UUID format requirements while enabling user identification. This is preferred over relying on withdrawal triggers, as withdrawals can be rejected or fail.

### Withdrawal Processing Flow
1. **Create Withdrawal**: Submit to Prime API with proper idempotency key
2. **Transaction Appears**: Listener detects new withdrawal transaction
3. **Status Check**: Waits for "TRANSACTION_DONE" status
4. **User Matching**: Matches via idempotency key prefix
5. **Balance Update**: Debits user balance atomically
6. **Confirmation**: Logs successful processing

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check User Balances
```sql
SELECT u.name, ab.asset, ab.balance 
FROM users u 
JOIN account_balances ab ON u.id = ab.user_id
WHERE ab.balance > 0;
```

### View Recent Transactions
```sql
SELECT u.name, t.transaction_type, t.asset, t.amount, t.created_at
FROM transactions t
JOIN users u ON t.user_id = u.id  
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Balance Reconciliation
```sql
SELECT 
  ab.user_id,
  ab.asset,
  ab.balance as current_balance,
  COALESCE(SUM(t.amount), 0) as calculated_balance
FROM account_balances ab
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON ab.user_id = t.user_id AND ab.asset = t.asset
GROUP BY ab.user_id, ab.asset;
```
